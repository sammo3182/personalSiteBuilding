      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;featured-hex.png&#34; width = &#34;350&#34; height = &#34;250&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on the structure of political engagements and their resonance within contemporary society.&#xA;We investigate the construction of political interests and cognition among today&amp;rsquo;s citizens, their modes of political participation in the digital era, and the interplay between public attitudes, opinions, and the processes of politicization and modernization.&#xA;This project is particularly concerned with the implications of public expression and involvement in sociopolitical matters for the individuals involved, as well as for society and the state at large.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;featured-hex.png&#34; width = &#34;260&#34; height = &#34;200&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Language stands as a quintessential attribute of humanity.&#xA;The enduring debate over whether language shapes thought or vice versa has captivated the greatest minds across history.&#xA;Yet, the role of language in the political sphere remains underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Approaching from an empirical perspective, this project aims to uncover the impacts of linguistic relativity and language policy on the dynamics between government and the public, as well as on the formation and reformation of collective political consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>State and its Audience    
国家与它的受众

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;featured-hex.png&#34; width = &#34;260&#34; height = &#34;330&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Individuals are not passive in their responses to the dominant cultural actions of their own and other countries.&#xA;Despite appearing significantly weaker in the face of powerful state propaganda machinery, they retain sufficient agency to &lt;strong&gt;identify&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;understand&lt;/strong&gt; political propaganda, and to some extent, &lt;strong&gt;influence&lt;/strong&gt; its impact on themselves.&#xA;We are particularly interested in how this process from the macro to the micro level is realized.&#xA;This interest distinguishes our research team&amp;rsquo;s perspective from the political communication and political socialization studies that focus primarily on the state side and commnicational paths.&#xA;Our work delves deeper into the receivers&amp;rsquo; responses, exploring their feelings, comprehension, and actions in response to political messages from the government.&#xA;A fundamental yet complex question underpins this research: who constitutes the audience for the state authority (in media environment, formal and informal education, international society) and why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
