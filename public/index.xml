      <description>Analysis of political data is a gateway course of political methodology and is compulsory for students in Political Science. The course introduces students to statistical and econometric knowledge for the analysis of quantitative data and provides a basis for more advanced statistical methods. After covering the fundamental concepts of statistics, such as probability and distributions, we will explore the classical normal linear regression model and its assumptions. We will also discuss the consequences and remedies for violations of these assumptions, including omitted variables, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and endogeneity.</description>

      <description>Analysis of Public Policy: Perspectives and Methods focuses on empirical policy evaluation. The course introduces a political scientist view and a series of modern empirical methods into public policy analyses. Students will learn not only the fundamental analytic theories for public policy evaluation but also tools such as case study, survey, experiments, and big-data analysis, that can be used to analyze different types of policies. In every topic, we will include real-life cases to illustrate how the theories and method can be applied.</description>

      <description>Policies are everywhere in the modern society. They serve as the tie between the rulers and ruled and the means to steer collective actions for the given goals. In this sense, the ability to understand where policy comes from and how it runs and ends has become a crucial quality of the potential successors and leaders. Understanding Public Policies: Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Case Illustrations is the place you cultivate this quality.</description>

      <guid>/project/inequality/</guid>
      <description>This project delves into socioeconomic disparities, examining the systematic differences in income, assets, mobility, and access to resources among citizens. Our team is interested in the impact, pathways, and mechanisms of this structural property on the political decisions and behaviors of individuals and groups. Specifically, the project seeks to understand the dimensions of inequality that people recognize and how this recognition influences their political awareness, preferences, and choices. Furthermore, it investigates the origins of the public&amp;rsquo;s perceptions of inequality: what&amp;mdash;or perhaps who&amp;mdash;influence these perceptions?</description>

      <description>This project focuses on the structure of political engagements and their resonance within contemporary society. We investigate the construction of political interests and cognition among today&amp;rsquo;s citizens, their modes of political participation in the digital era, and the interplay between public attitudes, opinions, and the processes of politicization and modernization. This project is particularly concerned with the implications of public expression and involvement in sociopolitical matters for the individuals involved, as well as for society and the state at large.</description>

      <description>Language stands as a quintessential attribute of humanity. The enduring debate over whether language shapes thought or vice versa has captivated the greatest minds across history. Yet, the role of language in the political sphere remains underexplored.&#xA;Approaching from an empirical perspective, this project aims to uncover the impacts of linguistic relativity and language policy on the dynamics between government and the public, as well as on the formation and reformation of collective political consciousness.</description>

      <description>Individuals are not passive in their responses to the dominant cultural actions of their own and other countries. Despite appearing significantly weaker in the face of powerful state propaganda machinery, they retain sufficient agency to identify and understand political propaganda, and to some extent, influence its impact on themselves. We are particularly interested in how this process from the macro to the micro level is realized. This interest distinguishes our research team&amp;rsquo;s perspective from the political communication and political socialization studies that focus primarily on the state side and commnicational paths.</description>
